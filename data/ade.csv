"With the negative viral serologies, the clinical picture was most consistent with an infectious mononucleosis-like syndrome produced by the minocycline ingestion.",1
We conclude that the presence of this metabolic defect combined with topical 5-FU (a drug demonstrating a narrow therapeutic index) results in the unusual presentation of life-threatening toxicity after treatment with a topical drug.,1
We now report the first known cancer patient who developed life-threatening complications after treatment with topical 5-FU and was shown subsequently to have profound DPD deficiency.,1

"We conclude that (a) cyclophosphamide is a human teratogen, (b) a distinct phenotype exists, and (c) the safety of CP in pregnancy is in serious question.",1
"In all cases, seizures were controlled by withdrawal of phenytoin and reduction of drug levels.",1
Paradoxical seizures in phenytoin toxicity.,1
"We present three patients with paradoxical seizures; their serum phenytoin levels were 43.5 mcg/mL, 46.5 mcg/mL and 38.3 mcg/mL.",1

"The incidence of angioedema secondary to losartan, an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, is unknown.",1

Hydroxyurea (HU) and sodium phenylbutyrate (SPB) have been shown to increase fetal hemoglobin (Hb F) levels in patients with thalassemia intermedia.,1
"Of the four patients who responded to HU with an increase in total Hb, all reported symptomatic improvement and three have not required further transfusions.",1
Prolonged responses were achieved with low doses of HU (3-10 mg/kg/day) and higher doses were associated with mild reversible hematologic or hepatic toxicity and no further increases in Hb.,1
"Sodium phenylbutyrate was added to treatment with HU in two patients, but failed to produce an increase in total Hb despite increasing Hb F levels.",1
We conclude that low-dose HU therapy in patients with thalassemia intermedia may increase total Hb levels sufficiently to eliminate the need for transfusions.,1
"We describe the clinical response, as determined by increases in total Hb and decreased transfusion needs, in five patients with thalassemia intermedia treated with HU alone or in combination with SPB.",1
"A 36-y-o patient with schizophrenia, who had consumed gradually increasing quantities of oolong tea that eventually reached 15 L each day, became delirious and was admitted to a psychiatric hospital.",1

Severe rhabdomyolysis following massive ingestion of oolong tea: caffeine intoxication with coexisting hyponatremia.,1
"The clinical course suggests that caffeine, which is present in oolong tea, was mainly responsible for the rhabdomyolysis as well as the delirium, although severe hyponatremia has been reported to cause rhabdomyolysis on rare occasions.",1
The possibility of severe rhabdomyolysis should be considered in a patient with water intoxication due to massive ingestion of caffeine-containing beverages.,1
"We hypothesize that caffeine toxicity injured the muscle cells, which were fragile due to the potassium depletion induced by the coexisting hyponatremia, to result in unusually severe rhabdomyolysis.",1
"After the addition of citalopram, a desmethylclomipramine plasma level increase and an 8-hydroacy-desmethylclomipramine plasma level decrease were observed.",1

We believe that this is the first description of acute hepatitis caused by an idiosyncratic adverse reaction to gliclazide or to one of its metabolites.,1
"We describe the case of acute hepatitis induced by gliclazide, a second generation sulfonylurea.",1

The favourable outcome in these two patients contrasts with the fatal outcome of the two other reported cases of nitrofurantoin induced BOOP.,1
The spectrum of nitrofurantoin lung injury continues to widen.,1
The two middle aged women presented with respiratory symptoms after prolonged treatment with nitrofurantoin.,1
"We suggest that the previous classification of nitrofurantoin induced lung injury into ""acute"" and ""chronic"" injury is an oversimplification in view of the wide variety of pathological entities that have subsequently emerged.",1
Intravenous administration of levodopa ameliorated a refractory akathisia case induced by interferon-alpha.,1
The present report illustrates a rare case of refractory akathisia after interferon-alpha treatment and also that levodopa treatment would be theoretically and practically useful in reducing the neurotoxicity associated with interferon-alpha.,1

This case report illustrates the use of continuous high-dose intracoronary nitroglycerin infusion through a 6 French coronary guiding catheter in the treatment of a patient with cocaine-induced refractory coronary vasospasm.,1
"However, as illustrated by these and other cases reported to date, the onset of troglitazone-induced liver injury is insidious and temporally variable.",1
It remains to be seen whether the hepatotoxicity associated with troglitazone is a drug-class effect or specific to troglitazone.,1
Other thiazolidinediones currently in clinical trials may be able to provide the therapeutic benefits of troglitazone without significant hepatotoxicity.,1
The three reported cases demonstrate that troglitazone is an idiosyncratic hepatotoxin that can lead to irreversible liver injury.,1
Troglitazone-induced fulminant hepatic failure.,1

"Slow acetylators, who comprise roughly 50% of the South African population, are likely to develop clinical and biochemical features of phenytoin toxicity when this drug is given together with antituberculosis therapy.",1

These evolutional changes in both proteinuria and glomerular histology suggest a close linkage between the M-CSF treatment and macrophage-related glomerular injury.,1
"We describe a patient with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) who developed nephrotic syndrome after receiving several courses of chemotherapy, including macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF).",1
